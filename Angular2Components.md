In [Angular 2](http://learnangular2.com/components/), *“everything is a component.”* Components are the main way we build and specify elements and logic on the page, through both custom elements and attributes that add functionality to our existing components.

[Understanding Component Architecture](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-component-architecture-angular/) (4/25/17)


After doing that and the Angular 2 Getting Started video, then 
[Component architecture recipes for Angular’s reactive forms](https://toddmotto.com/component-architecture-reactive-forms-angular), seems like a good exercise to learn more. `<https://toddmotto.com/component-architecture-reactive-forms-angular>` (5/9/17)

[Free Public Data Sets For Your First Data Science Project](https://www.springboard.com/blog/free-public-data-sets-data-science-project/)

These data-sets cover a variety of sources: demographic data, economic data, text data, and corporate data. 19 Data Sets in all.

1. United States Census Data: The United States Census publishes reams of demographic data at the state, city, and even zip code level. The data set is fantastic for creating geographic data visualizations and can be accessed on the Census Website. Alternatively, the data can be accessed via an API. One convenient way to use that API is through the chloroplethr. In general, this data is very clean and very comprehensive. 
1. FBI Crime Data: The FBI crime data set is fascinating. If you’re interested in analyzing time series data, you can use it to chart changes in crime rates at the national level over a 20 year period. Alternatively, you can look at the data geographically. 
1. CDC Cause of Death: The Center for Disease Control control maintains a database on cause of death. The data can be segmented in almost every way imaginable: age, race, year, and so on. 
1. Bureau of Labor Statistics: Many important economic indicators for the United States (like unemployment and inflation) can be found on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. Most of the data can be segmented both by time and by geography. 
1. The Bureau of Economic Analysis: The Bureau of Economic Analysis also has national and regional economic data, like GDP and exchange rates. 
2. Walmart: Walmart has released store level sales data for 98 items across 45 stores. This is an excellent data for time series analysis and has interesting seasonal components as well.
