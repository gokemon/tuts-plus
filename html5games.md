## HTML5 Games ##

Over the years I have built many games, starting in 1984 with Apple Basic and building an artillery game. Bart Simson cruisers, and other stupid things you find in Byte magazine. I still don't feel like a programmer, but I persist. 

HTML5 came along and it has good bones for coding games.
I have build tic-tac-toe, memory, simon, bingo and few others. 

I will add my links to my games here, and some tutorials
