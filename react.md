# React #

----------


So starting in 2014, there was Backbone, and ***it was good***.

Then in I started becoming aware of AngularJS, and by 2016 I was decent with it.
And along came React, and I figured, ok, I'll get to it later. 

Then comes 2017, and AgularJS is now just Angular (2 or 4) 

So far I really don't care for React. I am not building FaceBook, Twitter, Instagram, or the feed-heavy social media apps. 

*However*, I am going to start learning a little about it, because sometimes, the tutorials I want to learn something else about, say Docker for instance,  are building an app with react. So in order to better understand the main material and not get lost in, *"what is what?"* I figure learning a little react won't hurt me.
