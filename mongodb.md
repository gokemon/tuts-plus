OK, so my Main ReadMe has lots about Notes and everything else. And now I am wanting to build a secure API system to go with my awesome Angular apps. So back to MEN, Mongo, Express and Node.

[Build a Node.js API in Under 30 Minutes](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/building-a-simple-node-js-api-in-under-30-minutes-a07ea9e390d2) Looks promising


[Introduction-to-express.js-MongoDB-with-Typescript2](https://github.com/ramlez/Introduction-to-express.js-MongoDB-with-Typescript2) Looks easy enough, but no tutorial, just pick apart the code. But I really want to use TypeScript to tighten up my skills.
