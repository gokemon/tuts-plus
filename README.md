A learning resource 

There is not going to be any code in this repo, merely this readme and people notes.
This readme will grow, as we fulfill pull requests.
So partly is about merge "code" branches in Git and GitHub across people, as well as not messing up each persons "notes".

This readme will serve as our "shared" location for Learning Resources.
OK, so I have some clean up on which ones we have done, and when, and which we have not.

**Docker**

I need to do a Docker soon, so I have a basic handle on it. After figuring out that the Digital Ocean stuff costs money ($10 a month for a basic MEAN-stack) that I can get from Heroku free. Lets see what Docker is and if its worth it.
